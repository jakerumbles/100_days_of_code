# 100 Days of Code

<b>Day 21</b>
  <p>Took a week off....woops. Started back with some more work on the color project. Excited to finish this so I can get on to React hooks and server-side rendering!</p>

<b>Day 20</b>
  <p>Completed more code-along videos on the color picker project. It's now the biggest react project I've worked on.</p>

<b>Day 19</b>
  <p>Didn't really code for an hour today, but I did a small addition to the color picker website. I used Material UI and added selector for which type of color value to copy when the color is clicked on.</p>

<b>Day 18</b>
  <p>Started the final major project for my React course. It's a color picker website. Going well so far. Lots more functionality to be added. This is gonna take a number of days to finish.</p>

<b>Day 17</b>
  <p>Started learning about React Router and completed the first exercise, a simple page with a few components to route to from the home page plus a navbar.</p>

<b>Day 16</b>
  <p>Completed the Dad Jokes code along where I continued to practice pulling data from API's and using componentDidMount(). Also learned how to save state in the browser so data stays the same after a refresh.</p>

<b>Day 15</b>
  <p>Finished Yahtzee code along. Then started learning about React lifecycle methods. Also completed an exercise creating a deck of cards by pulling from a card deck API. It was a productive Saturday!</p>

<b>Day 14</b>
  <p>Completed part of the Yahtzee code along. Did my best to implement the code myself before watching the solution, but really struggled on some it. Although, it wasn't so much the React I was struggling with, but Javascript array functions and classes.</p>

<b>Day 13</b>
  <p>Finished the todo list project. Getting a hang of React basic design patterns using components, state, and props.</p>

<b>Day 12</b>
  <p>Completed most of a todo list project. Was able to code most of it without watching the code along video. Feeling good today!</p>

<b>Day 11</b>
  <p>Learned about forms in React and completed a code along exercise. Learning these React state patterns with smart parent components and dumb child components.</p>

<b>Day 10</b>
  <p>Completed the Lights Out game code along. Definitely struggled to implement some functionality before watching the solution. Next onto Forms.</p>

<b>Day 8-9</b>
  <p>Started back on the Moder React Bootcamp. Learned some about events from <em>onClick()</em> and completed some updates to a Hangman game. Onto a cooler game tomorrow!</p>

<b>Day 1-7</b>
  <p>Worked on my TrollBot Discord bot. I got the basic functionality working: you can send the bot a message with the <em>!speak</em> command and the bot will speak the text out to the voice channel. It doesn't run as fast as I would like. Ended up getting bored with the project and want to get back to learing React and Javascript</p>
