# 100 Days of Code

<b>Day 11</b>
  <p>Learned about forms in React and completed a code along exercise. Learning these React state patterns with smart parent components and dumb child components.</p>

<b>Day 10</b>
  <p>Completed the Lights Out game code along. Definitely struggled to implement some functionality before watching the solution. Next onto Forms.</p>

<b>Day 8-9</b>
  <p>Started back on the Moder React Bootcamp. Learned some about events from <em>onClick()</em> and completed some updates to a Hangman game. Onto a cooler game tomorrow!</p>

<b>Day 1-7</b>
  <p>Worked on my TrollBot Discord bot. I got the basic functionality working: you can send the bot a message with the <em>!speak</em> command and the bot will speak the text out to the voice channel. It doesn't run as fast as I would like. Ended up getting bored with the project and want to get back to learing React and Javascript</p>
